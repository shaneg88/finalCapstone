This project is named task_manager

This project is designed for an admin user to be able to see all tasks that are registered and who they are registered to,
as well as percentages of competed and overdue tasks
it has a function for adding new users and logins and also will not allow duplication of login details
it also allows users to add new tasks or edit existing ones

To use the program a .txt file called users with admin, adm1n on line 1 and a .txt file called tasks are required
so a base login is set up and the tasks have somewhere to be stored

as far as usage of the program it is self explanatory, you are provided with a menu detailing each selection,
make choices based on what you want to do and then follow on screen instructions
